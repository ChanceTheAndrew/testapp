3. Courteous and enthusiastic, I am interested in IT and everything in its orbit. I recently began to be fascinated by web programming, e.g. developing apps and building websites. As this area complements my studies, I am keen to gain more experience in the field. For this reason, I am looking for a company willing to offer me a placement among their developers. In return, I would offer my full commitment, and be a pleasant and friendly addition to your team.
I am therefore currently looking for a job or an internship as a front-end developer.

```
module.exports = function getLoveTrianglesCount(preferences = []) {

  var count = 0;

  for (var i = 0; i < preferences.length; i++) {

    var a = preferences[i], b = preferences[a - 1], c = preferences[b - 1];

    if (preferences[i] == 'Checked') continue;

    if (c == i + 1 && isArrayDigitsDifferent([a, b, c])) {

      count++;

      preferences[i] = preferences[a - 1] = preferences[b - 1] = 'Checked'
    }
  }
  return count;
};
function isArrayDigitsDifferent(array = []) {

  return array.every((el, i, arr) => el != arr[i - 1]);
